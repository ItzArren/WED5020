        <p>Stray Paws rescues, fosters, and places dogs and cats that are homeless, abandoned, injured, or ill. Each animal in our care undergoes testing for common diseases such as Parvo Virus, receives a behavioral assessment, and is given essential medical treatment, including vaccinations, deworming, and sterilization before being adopted into permanent homes. Our team of volunteers, skilled in common dog and cat behavior issues, is available to offer guidance to both foster providers and adopters.</p>
        <p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we launched our Surrender Prevention Program. On weekends, our volunteers assist individuals who are considering surrendering their pets by addressing and resolving any issues that may be leading to their decision. To help families avoid giving up their pets due to financial constraints or unemployment, we provide free animal food.</p>
        <p>Exceptional customer service is central to our philosophy. We strive to make everyone who interacts with our organization feel welcomed and like a part of our family. Our goal is to place animals into their forever homes as swiftly as possible so we can rescue more lives. We are dedicated to ensuring the adoption process is as smooth and efficient as we can make it.</p>
        <p>Help us make a real difference to lives of these loving animals</p>
