<p>“Stray Paws wishes no animal endures a life of pain, abandonment or neglect” – Stray Paws</p>
<p>Stray Paws, established as a registered non-profit in November 2019, is committed solely to rescuing animals that are neglected, orphaned, or abused. Most of our cases arise from low-income communities, collaborations with other welfare groups, or urgent rescue scenarios. Our mission at Stray Paws is to prioritize the rescue and rehabilitation of these animals, and we also work to educate pet owners on the best practices for animal care and management.</p>
<p>We promote and support sterilizations and vaccinations whenever possible. Our goal is to improve the lives of disadvantaged animals, ensuring they can enjoy a healthy, pain-free, and happy life. Caring for these animals is costly, with our average monthly veterinary expenses around R30,000. Therefore, we greatly value donations and sponsorships from individuals and businesses, whether in the form of pet food, medical supplies, accessories, or monetary contributions.</p>
