      <h1> About Us </h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Stray Paws is a non-profit, volunteer-based animal welfare organization dedicated to rescuing homeless dogs and cats, who are sick, abandoned, surrendered and in need of medical care in the greater Durban and surrounding areas. This includes KwaDabeka, Ntuzuma, Inanda, KwaMashu, Tongaat and Verulam, Reit River, Ottawa, Phoenix, Newlands  East and West, Clare Estate and surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>By working with a network of volunteer advocates, foster caregivers, local veterinarians, trainers and shelters, Stray Paws is able to rescue hundreds of animals every year. We provide these animals with care and temporary homes until we can place them into their permanent homes. We also serve as a resource to our community by providing information on pet ownership and care, including resources for spay/neuter, positive behaviour training, nutrition and veterinary care. We believe that no animal should be mistreated and are working towards the day when no companion animal is euthanized for lack of a home.</p>
      <p>Stray Paws was founded in 2019 by a 3 animal advocates in Durban after learning that the area had been inundated with stray and relinquished animals. Stray Paws formed to rescue as many stray and homeless animals as possible and assist people in the rural settlement and townships who are unable to provide medical care, food, sterilisations, vaccinations and deworming or their dogs and cats.</p>

      <h1>Our Goal</h1>
      <p>Our mission is to provide a safe home for previously disadvantaged animals, we aim to reduce the number of neglected & abused cats and dogs in the community.</p>
      <p>Our other area of focus is sterilization, we aim to sterilize many animals from rural and underprivileged areas. We aim to assist with sterilization as doing this curbs the spread of reproduction, starvation and diseases. We work with vets who assist us with sterilization and help us with setting up and administering sterilization clinics in these underprivileged areas.</p>
      <p>We would love for you to adopt or be part of our network in some way.</p>
